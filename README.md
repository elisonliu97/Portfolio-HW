# Portfolio-HW

This is my sample portfolio website. In this website, there is a header with a navigation bar that directly takes you to the main sections. The first section is the about me section, where theres a little paragraph about what I want to accomplish with this website. The second section is the portfolio section, where it showcases some of my applications. These are shown through images that when clicked, will take you to the deployed applications. The third section is the contact me, where there are links to my email, LinkedIn, and Github.
